The Pomodoro Technique® is a time management method. This Technique helps you to transform time into a valuable ally by helping you accomplish what you want to do and charting continuous improvement in the way you do it.

Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique® in the 1980s after a long search to improve his own study habits. The technique caught on with professional teams in the 90’s.

This isn't like any other time-management method on the market today. What makes it so unique?
1. WORK WITH TIME - NOT AGAINST IT
2. ELIMINATE BURNOUT
3. MANAGE DISTRACTIONS
4. CREATE A BETTER WORK / LIFE BALANCE

Above all, the greatest goal is to have time as your friend!
